# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Retention-Strategies
Customer churn is a critical issue for companies that offer services on a subscription or contract basis. The telecommunications industry is no exception. Telecommunications companies lose millions of dollars annually as customers switch to competitors or simply drop their services. Hence, customer churn prediction models are valuable tools for these companies to retain their customers. In this project, the objective was to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn from a telecommunications company. The dataset used for the project contained various features related to customer demographics, usage patterns, and account information. The dataset was pre-processed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables before training various classification models. The performance of these models was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
